the current directory has four folders as:
all_descriptors, bonding_components, imp_bonding, individual_tt_dt, max_depth_analysis
The folders contains training, testing, and final score values used in the manuscript
all_descriptors: when all the descriptors were used
bonding_components: the folders contains three sub-folders as "angles","bonds",and "dihedrals". The subfolders calculates the values using angles, bonds, and dihedrals descriptors
imp_bonding:the folders contains three sub-folders as "imp_angles","imp_bonds",and "imp_dihedrals".The subfolders calculates the values using top angles, bonds, and dihedrals descriptors identified from PCA.
individual_tt_dt:the folders contains six sub-folders as "atom_name", "atom_types", "bonding", "molecular_attributes", "molecular_types", "mol_wt".The sub-folders contain files correspond to descriptors as mentioned in the manuscript
max_depth_analysis:the files contain the score values during maximum depth analysis
